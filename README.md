# DrivAerNet
DrivAerNet: A Parametric Car Dataset for Data-driven Aerodynamic Design and Graph-Based Drag Prediction

## Introduction
DrivAerNet is a large-scale, high-fidelity CFD dataset of 3D industry-standard car shapes designed for data-driven aerodynamic design. It comprises 4000 high-quality 3D car meshes and their corresponding aerodynamic performance coefficients, alongside full 3D pressure and velocity fields.

## Dataset Details
- **3D Car Meshes**: 4000 designs with 0.5 million elements each.
- **Aerodynamic Coefficients**: Includes Cd, Cl, Clr, Clf, and Cm.
- **CFD Simulation Data**: Full 3D pressure, velocity fields, and wall-shear stresses computed using 8 million mesh elements.

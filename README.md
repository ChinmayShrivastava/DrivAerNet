# DrivAerNet++

We present DrivAerNet++, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for aerodynamic car design. DrivAerNet++ comprises 8,000 diverse car designs modeled with high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The dataset includes diverse car configurations such as fastback, notchback, and estateback, with different underbody and wheel designs to represent both internal combustion engines and electric vehicles.

## Design Parameters

Design parameters for the generation of the DrivAerNet++ dataset. Several geometric parameters with significant impact on aerodynamics were selected and varied within a specific range. These parameter ranges were chosen to avoid values that are either difficult to manufacture or not aesthetically pleasing.

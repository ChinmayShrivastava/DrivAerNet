# DrivAerNet
DrivAerNet: A Parametric Car Dataset for Data-driven Aerodynamic Design and Graph-Based Drag Prediction

## Introduction
DrivAerNet is a large-scale, high-fidelity CFD dataset of 3D industry-standard car shapes designed for data-driven aerodynamic design. It comprises 4000 high-quality 3D car meshes and their corresponding aerodynamic performance coefficients, alongside full 3D flow field information.

## Dataset Details
- **3D Car Meshes**: 4000 designs with 0.5 million elements each.
- **Aerodynamic Coefficients**: Includes Cd, Cl, Clr, Clf, and Cm.
- **CFD Simulation Data**: Full 3D pressure, velocity fields, and wall-shear stresses computed using 8 million mesh elements.

## Parametric Model 
The DrivAerNet dataset includes a parametric model of the DrivAer fastback, developed using ANSAÂ® software to enable extensive exploration of automotive design variations. This model is defined by 50 geometric parameters, allowing the generation of 4000 unique car designs through Optimal Latin Hypercube sampling and the Enhanced Stochastic Evolutionary Algorithm.
